<p class="about">
    Chris Daze Ellis was born in New York City in 1962. He started his career in the subway cars of NYC fourteen years later, in 1976, while going to The High School of Art and Design. One of the most influential facts about him is that he is one of the few
    artists of his generation to make the transition from subways to sudios successfully.
