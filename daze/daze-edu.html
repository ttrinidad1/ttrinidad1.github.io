    <h2>Educational Outreach</h2>
    <h3>Mentorship</h3>
    <p>Most recently, Daze has been interested in inspiring young students to create and collaborate just as he first did in the 70s. He didn't think he would make a good mentor at first and surprised himself: </p>
    <blockquote>"My work with kids and students is not something I planned on happening. At first it was an opportunity, then I realized that it was something I was good at...I'm not using kids as my assistants; I'm trying to bring out their own creativity in what
        they do."" </blockquote>
    <p>He describes his teaching style as "do-it-yourself" which is an attitude he adopted early on in his career with his work on the streets. </p>
    <blockquote>"I encourage students to look at me as a door that they can walk through and come out with experience."</blockquote>

    <p>Daze goes to underdeveloped parts of the world and underserved neighborhoods to teach workshops and encourage learning through drawing and painting. He was also sent to Quito, Ecuador as part of the smARTpower initiative, a program with the Department
        of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, administered by The Bronx Museum of the Arts that sends artists abroad to work with local artists and young people around the world to create community-based art projects. </p>
